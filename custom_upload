To create a template...
  1. Open Jamf Migrator
  2. Sign in to your Jamf Pro Servers (Source is where the templates come from. Destination doesn't matter)
  3. Menu -> Preferences -> Export -> Ensure "Save Only" is checked
  4. From the Jamf Pro listings choose what you wish to bundle as a template/workflow
  5. Navigate to ~/Documents/Jamf Migrator/trimmed,  verify XMLs found in folders are desired and nothing is missing
      **If items are missing, add additional items in Jamf Migrator. Previously exported stays.
  6. Copy the whole "trimmed" folder to the desktop
  7. Rename "trimmed" to desired workflow name, single string only, like: one_click_mojave_selfservice
  8. Compress folder to .zip and upload!

NOTE: Before making templates, clone items in Jamf and remove company/sensitive variables, and notate variables in a text file in the folder prior to compressing/zip.
