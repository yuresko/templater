Industry Templates
------------------

Industry templates are used to build out a Jamf Pro server with pre-defined workflows intended for testing. 
These are Jamf-curated demo environments and can assist in quickly getting off the ground and comfortable in Jamf Pro.

Only click one option per Jamf Pro server as each option may populate your Jamf Pro instance with hundreds of records!


NOTE: DO NOT use in production environments! Reach out to your Jamf sales representitives for assistance.
